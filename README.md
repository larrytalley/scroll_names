# scroll_names
# 
# simple javascript program to read an input file of names, year of birth, year of death,
# sort the input data lines by year of death, insert "decade rows" to categorize the list
# by decade of death, and finally scroll the names across the screen, timed to complete
# the entire list in the amount of time that it takes to play a particular piece of music.
#
# this is intended to provide a backdrop of scrolling names and dates on a screen while
# a memoriam piece of music plays.
